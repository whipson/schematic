# schematic

schematic is an R package that makes it easy to validate a data.frame
against a schemaâ€”checking column types, nullability, and more. Itâ€™s
designed with user-facing applications in mind, providing clear and
expressive error messages that help users understand and fix their data
issues.

Key features of schematic include:

âœ… Declarative schema definitions using tidyselect syntax

ðŸ’¬ User-friendly error messages designed for use in Shiny apps and APIs

ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive reporting of all schema violations, not just the first

Use schematic when you want flexible and expressive schema validation,
especially in contexts where informative feedback mattersâ€”like a Shiny
app, a plumber endpoint, or any tool that consumes user-submitted data
(e.g., .csv uploads).

``` r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/whipson/schematic")
```

Use `schema()` to create a Schema. Names and tidyselect expressions on
the left of the tilde (LHS) correspond to column names and expressions
on the right (RHS) are predicate functions that return TRUE or FALSE.

``` r
library(schematic)

my_schema <- schema(
  ints ~ is.integer,
  pos_int ~ is_positive_integer,
  starts_with("num") ~ is.numeric,
  c(fct1, another_fct) ~ is.factor,
  times ~ function(x) inherits(x, "POSIXct"),
  c(some_import_col) ~ is.numeric
)
```

`check_schema()` returns an informative error including the names of the
columns that failed the schema and the reason that they failed.

``` r
# Test data.frame with some errors sprinkled in
my_df <- data.frame(
  ints = 1L:5L,
  pos_int = 1L:5L,
  num1 = rnorm(5),
  num2 = rpois(1, 5),
  fct1 = letters[1:5],
  another_fct = letters[6:10],
  times = "2025-04-09"
)

check_schema(
  my_df,
  my_schema
)
```

    Error in `check_schema()`:
    ! Schematic Error:
    - Column `some_import_col` missing from data
    - Columns `fct1` and `another_fct` failed check `is.factor`
    - Column `times` failed check `function(x) inherits(x, "POSIXct")`

You can also supply argument names in `schema()` to customize the output
of the message.

``` r
my_schema <- schema(
  `is a whole number` = my_int ~ is.integer
)

my_df <- data.frame(
  my_int = c(-1, 2, 0.4)
)

check_schema(my_df, my_schema)
```

    Error in `check_schema()`:
    ! Schematic Error:
    - Column `my_int` failed check `is a whole number`
